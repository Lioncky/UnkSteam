Human Revolution would bear replaying even without the enhancements — it's a rare title that combines superb world building and storytelling with such dedication to player choice. I lost myself in the world of Human Revolution, and relished every opportunity to dive deeper into its mysteries.”<br>9\/10 – Polygon<br><br>“With a story that lasts hours on end, additional DLC that will keep you challenged throughout (wait till you get to Missing Link), unbeatable touch-screen implementation and a majority of the same great stuff from the original release, the Director's Cut of Deus Ex: Human Revolution definitely deserves a look. This is how the game was meant to be played, especially on the Wii U, even with its wide control set-up. It's easily an advantage that the system needs this holiday season.”<br>9\/10 – GamerHub TV<br>","header_image":"https:\/\/shared.akamai.steamstatic.com\/store_item_assets\/steam\/apps\/238010\/header.jpg?t=1726596595","capsule_image":"https:\/\/shared.akamai.steamstatic.com\/store_item_assets\/steam\/apps\/238010\/capsule_231x87.jpg?t=1726596595","capsule_imagev5":"https:\/\/shared.akamai.steamstatic.com\/store_item_assets\/steam\/apps\/238010\/capsule_184x69.jpg?t=1726596595","website":null,"pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>最低配置:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>操作系统 *:<\/strong> Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8<br><\/li><li><strong>处理器:<\/strong> 2 GHz dual core<br><\/li><li><strong>内存:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>显卡:<\/strong> NVIDIA GeForce 8000 series or ATI Radeon HD 2000 series or better<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX 版本:<\/strong> 9.0c<br><\/li><li><strong>存储空间:<\/strong> 需要 17 GB 可用空间<br><\/li><li><strong>声卡:<\/strong> 100% DirectX 9.0c compatible sound device<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>推荐配置:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>操作系统 *:<\/strong> Windows 7 or Windows 8<br><\/li><li><strong>处理器:<\/strong> AMD Phenom II X4 or Intel Core 2 Quad or better<br><\/li><li><strong>内存:<\/strong> 2 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>显卡:<\/strong> AMD Radeon HD 5850<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX 版本:<\/strong> 9.0c<br><\/li><li><strong>存储空间:<\/strong> 需要 17 GB 可用空间<br><\/li><li><strong>声卡:<\/strong> 100% DirectX 9.0c compatible sound device<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>最低配置:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>操作系统:<\/strong> 10.8.5<br><\/li><li><strong>处理器:<\/strong> 2.0Ghz<br><\/li><li><strong>内存:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>显卡:<\/strong> 512MB<br><\/li><li><strong>存储空间:<\/strong> 需要 25 GB 可用空间<br><\/li><li><strong>附注事项:<\/strong> The following graphics cards are not supported: ATI X1xxx series, ATI HD2xxx series, Intel GMA series, Intel HD3000, NVIDIA 7xxx series, NVIDIA 8xxx series, NVIDIA 9400 and NVIDIA 3xx series.
