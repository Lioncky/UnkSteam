Puzzles aren't terribly difficult, but usually come to a satisfying enough resolution, and always feel necessary to the overall narrative. While the game's commander, a voice over guide, can grated on my nerves, it's an easy defect to ignore in the face of an overall excellent sci-fi thriller adventure.”<br>8.3 \/ 10 – Road To VR<br><br>“It is pretty damn clear by now that I am impressed with this game. When it comes to design, this team nailed the most important aspect of a VR game. It has to feel natural. This goes into every area of game design, from world building, to narrative, all the way to how the player interacts with a button on a desk lamp. Red Matter is a shining example of what making the correct design decisions, for the story your trying to sell, looks like.”<br>9.6 \/ 10 – VR the Gamers<br><br>“All in all, Red Matter is a very high calibre VR experience, neatly weaving its story and puzzle elements together. It by no means perfect, following the line of other puzzles in VR that are seemingly unable to offer plenty of reasons to come back for more. So like a good meal take it slowly and savour the moment.”<br>8.0 \/ 10 –
