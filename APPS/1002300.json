The Idea is to use what you got at your disposal and be creative with it.","about_the_game":"<img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https:\/\/shared.akamai.steamstatic.com\/store_item_assets\/steam\/apps\/1002300\/extras\/whats.png?t=1621853752\" \/><br><br>Fear &amp; Hunger is a horror dungeon crawler set in the dark and hopeless dungeons of fear and hunger.
